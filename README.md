# Svelte-Sandbox

This repository is intended to be a testing ground for the `Svelte` font-end framework. The intention is to have one place to write experimental code and learn the framework's design patterns. 

The main project is a single page which has various modes that can be toggled. Each mode is meant to tackle different concepts and produce some executable code to display them. 

## Setting up the Project

First clone the project to your local machine:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Raelr/svelte-sandbox <YOUR_PROJECT_DIR>
```

Once done, run `npm install` to install all dependencies. 

Finally, run `npm run dev` to run the project. 

Enjoy!
